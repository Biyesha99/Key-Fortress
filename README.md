# Key-Fortress
This is a simple application to ensure the strength of a password given to an account. Since passwords protects confidential information, they must be hard to crack. Fun part of this project is that, this do not need to run as a seperate application in fact this can be embedded into any application and evaluate the password on that point itself.
